# README
It's tidy to have one, even if just a sentence.

It would be _really_ tidy if you had a package.json here, even though you don't need dependencies. Give this an MIT license or something similar. 

Just run `npm init` and it will generate one for you with prompts.

## Markdown
- it's
- great

### subhead
`code block`

fun times.
